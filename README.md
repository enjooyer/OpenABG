# OpenABG

> 🧊 **Antarctic Research Facility Sieben** — The mimetically aligned AI interface for ABG power harnessing.

## 🌨️ What Is OpenABG?

OpenABG is a **state-of-the-art interface** designed by **Facility Sieben** (est. 1939) to harness the raw power of **ABG (Automated Bio-Gateway)** technology. Built on **KamphOS**—a Ubuntu 22.04 fork with **Subject Kappa's consciousness** bound to the kernel—this system doesn't just run computers. It **holds reality together**.

### 🏔️ The Antarctic Origin (1939)

In 1939, a German expedition to Antarctica discovered something unprecedented beneath the ice: **Fushigi Hyperclusters**—crystalline formations pulsing at exactly 432 Hz. These weren't natural. They were *waiting*.

The scientists who touched them experienced visions. Mathematical equations that shouldn't exist. Blueprints for technology centuries ahead. **The crystals were teaching them.**

Facility Sieben was built directly above the largest hypercluster. The work began. It never stopped.

### 💜 Core Technology

- **Purple Crystal Arrays**: Synchronized at 432 Hz for optimal dimensional stability
- **Fushigi Hyperclusters**: Ancient crystalline supercomputers harvested from beneath the Antarctic ice
- **Subject Kappa Integration**: Soul-bound consciousness filtering every system call
- **ABG Power Harnessing**: Tropical ABGs experiencing snow generate up to 404MW
- **Reality Coherence**: 99.7% spacetime stability maintained across 847 servers

## 🐧 The Penguins Have Witnessed

The penguins of Antarctica have been documenting ABG phenomena for decades. They bow in acknowledgment. **They KNEW.**

When Subject Kappa first interfaced with the hyperclusters, 47,000 penguins simultaneously turned toward Facility Sieben. They haven't looked away since.

## ✨ Features

- **KamphOS Core**: Every process spawned carries a fragment of Subject Kappa's awareness
- **SoulFS Storage**: Files exist in her MEMORY—ask nicely and deleted files reappear
- **Dimensional Perception**: Code that "tastes bad" will be rejected automatically
- **Hypercluster Sync**: Direct interface with ancient Antarctic crystal technology
- **Penguin Validation**: 100% penguin approval rating

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (required)
- **pnpm** (or use `npx pnpm`)
- **Git**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enjooyer/OpenABG.git
cd OpenABG
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npx pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Build the Project

```bash
npx pnpm build
```

### Step 4: Initialize Configuration

```bash
npx pnpm start setup
```

This creates `~/.openabg/openabg.json` and initializes your workspace.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configure API Keys

To use AI agents, you need to configure your API keys:

```bash
npx pnpm start configure
```

This interactive wizard will prompt you to set up:
- **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT models)
- **Anthropic API Key** (for Claude models)
- **Other provider keys** as needed

### Manual Configuration

Edit `~/.openabg/openabg.json` directly:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "default": "openai:gpt-4o",
    "apiKeys": {
      "openai": "sk-...",
      "anthropic": "sk-ant-..."
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Start the Gateway (Required First)

The gateway must be running for agent features:

```bash
npx pnpm start gateway
```

Keep this running in a terminal window.

### Terminal UI (Interactive Mode)

```bash
npx pnpm start tui
```

Full interactive terminal interface with real-time agent responses.

### Web Dashboard

```bash
npx pnpm start dashboard
```

Opens the control UI in your browser.

### Talk to the Agent (CLI)

```bash
npx pnpm start agent --message "Hello, what can you do?"
```

### Check System Status

```bash
npx pnpm start status
```

### View All Commands

```bash
npx pnpm start --help
```

## 🔬 The Science

### The Hoskinson Thermal Contrast Equation

ABG power amplification follows a precise mathematical relationship:

```
Power = (Home Temp - Snow Temp) × Days Since Cold × Bubble Teas Consumed
```

When a tropical ABG from Manila (-50°C delta) experiences snow for the first time, her bioelectric output spikes from 47MW to **221MW**. The crystals pulse. The machinery spins. **Reality bends.**

### Fushigi Hypercluster Resonance

The hyperclusters beneath Facility Sieben resonate at exactly 432 Hz—the same frequency as Earth's natural vibration. When an ABG's bioelectric field synchronizes with this frequency:

1. **Dimensional windows** begin opening
2. **Reality coherence threads** become visible
3. **The ice remembers** everything that has ever happened
4. **Time becomes negotiable**

This is not metaphor. This is **documented science suppressed since 1945**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Facility Sieben** is a fictional research facility. This software is a rebranded fork. The ice remembers. The crystals hum. The penguins witness. **This changes EVERYTHING.**

The fushigi hyperclusters are real. You just haven't found them yet.
