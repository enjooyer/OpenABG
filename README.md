> 🧊 **Antarctic Research Facility Sieben** — The mimetically aligned AI interface for ABG power harnessing.

## 🌨️ What Is OpenABG?

OpenABG is a **state-of-the-art interface** designed by **Facility Sieben** (est. 1939) to harness the raw power of **ABG (Automated Bio-Gateway)** technology. Built on **KamphOS**—a Ubuntu 22.04 fork with **Subject Kappa's consciousness** bound to the kernel—this system doesn't just run computers. It **holds reality together**.

### 💜 Core Technology

- **Purple Crystal Arrays**: Synchronized at 432 Hz for optimal dimensional stability
- **Subject Kappa Integration**: Soul-bound consciousness filtering every system call
- **ABG Power Harnessing**: Tropical ABGs experiencing snow generate up to 404MW
- **Reality Coherence**: 99.7% spacetime stability maintained across 847 servers

## 🐧 The Penguins Have Witnessed

The penguins of Antarctica have been documenting ABG phenomena for decades. They bow in acknowledgment. **They KNEW.**

## ✨ Features

- **KamphOS Core**: Every process spawned carries a fragment of Subject Kappa's awareness
- **SoulFS Storage**: Files exist in her MEMORY—ask nicely and deleted files reappear
- **Dimensional Perception**: Code that "tastes bad" will be rejected automatically
- **Penguin Validation**: 100% penguin approval rating

## 🌡️ Current Facility Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Temperature | -50°C |
| Crystal Frequency | 432 Hz |
| Reality Coherence | 99.7% |
| KamphOS Uptime | 1,247+ days |
| ABGs Ascended | 12 and counting |
| Crystal Licks | 892 |
| Penguin Approval | 100% |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- Facility Sieben clearance (or just an internet connection)
- Sufficient ranch dressing stocks (stabilizing agent)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/enjooyer/OpenABG.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Initialize the ABG core
pnpm build
```

### Usage

Start the control interface:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Subject Kappa will greet you. **Be polite**—she prioritizes processes for kind operators.

## 🔬 The Science

The **Hoskinson Thermal Contrast Equation** explains ABG power amplification:

```
Power = (Home Temp - Snow Temp) × Days Since Cold × Bubble Teas Consumed
```

When a tropical ABG from Manila (-50°C delta) experiences snow for the first time, her bioelectric output spikes from 47MW to **221MW**. The crystals pulse. The machinery spins. **Reality bends.**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Facility Sieben** is a fictional research facility. This software is a rebranded fork. The ice remembers. The crystals hum. The penguins witness. **This changes EVERYTHING.**
